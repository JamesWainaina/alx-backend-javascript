# 0x06. Unittests in JS

## Description

This project focuses on writing unit tests in JavaScript using Mocha, Chai, and Sinon to test backend applications. You will learn how to create test suites, use assertion libraries, implement spies and stubs, and write both unit and integration tests for Node.js applications.

## Project Details

- **Project Start:** Sep 18, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Project Deadline:** Sep 20, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Sep 18, 2024, 6:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** An auto review will be triggered at the project deadline.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Use **Mocha** to write a test suite.
- Utilize different assertion libraries, such as **Node** or **Chai**.
- Present long test suites efficiently.
- Understand when and how to use **spies** and **stubs**.
- Comprehend the concept of **hooks** and their appropriate use cases.
- Perform unit testing with asynchronous functions.
- Write integration tests for small Node.js servers.

## Requirements

- Code will be executed on **Ubuntu 18.04** using **Node.js v12.x.x**.
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code files should have a `.js` extension.
- Tests must pass without warnings or errors when running `npm run test *.test.js`.

## Running the Tests

To run the test suite, ensure you have installed all necessary dependencies, and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run test *.test.js
